# Linear Regression Data Generation and Testing

## Overview

This project demonstrates the entire workflow of generating synthetic linear data, performing linear regression analysis, visualising the results, and validating the model parameters through automated unit testing.

The goal is to simulate real-world data with noise, fit a regression model, and ensure that the estimated slope and intercept accurately reflect the underlying parameters used in the data generation process.

## Project Structure

- **`Data_function.py`**  
  Implements the core functionality to:
  - Generate synthetic datasets following a linear relationship \( y = mx + b \) with added Gaussian noise.
  - Create and save a scatter plot illustrating the original data, the true underlying line, and the fitted regression line.
  - Save the generated data to a CSV file for reproducibility and further analysis.
  - Return the estimated slope and intercept of the fitted linear regression model.

- **`Unit_Test.py`**  
  Contains automated tests validating:
  - Whether the slope estimated from the noisy data is equal to the true slope.
  - Whether the intercept estimate is sufficiently close to the true intercept.
  - The use of Python’s built-in `unittest` framework ensures that changes to the data generation or analysis code can be confidently evaluated.

- **`data.csv`**  
  A snapshot of the synthetic dataset generated by the script, consisting of x and y coordinate pairs.

- **`plot.png`**  
  A visual representation of the generated data and regression lines, which helps in understanding the fit quality and the impact of noise.

## Technical Details

- **Data Generation**  
  Uses NumPy's `linspace` to generate evenly spaced x-values and `normal` to add Gaussian noise. This mimics measurement or environmental variability in data collection, commonly encountered in practical regression problems.

- **Linear Regression**  
  Utilises SciPy's `linregress` function to determine the best fitting slope and intercept parameters, along with associated statistics like the correlation coefficient and standard error.

- **Visualisation**  
  Matplotlib is used to plot:
  - The noisy synthetic data points (scatter).
  - The original underlying linear function (dashed line).
  - The fitted regression line (solid line).
  
  These elements provide an intuitive understanding of how well the model fits the data in the presence of noise.

- **Testing**  
  The testing framework ensures:
  - Reliability: parameters estimated from noisy data should be close enough to the true parameters.
  - Robustness: the function behaves as expected across different random realisations of noise.
  - Maintainability: tests can catch issues when making updates or refactoring code.

## Dependencies

This project requires several Python packages commonly used in data analysis:

- **numpy** – For numerical computations and data generation.
- **pandas** – For data handling and CSV export.
- **matplotlib** – For plotting and visualisation.
- **scipy** – For performing linear regression analysis.
- **unittest** – Python’s standard testing framework.

Ensure these dependencies are installed in your Python environment to fully utilise the project's features.

## Purpose and Applications

This project provides a foundation for learning and applying linear regression concepts on synthetic data, making it ideal for:

- Educational use in statistics, machine learning, or data science courses.
- Testing different noise levels and their effects on regression parameter estimates.
- Developing reliable data generation and testing workflows that can be extended to more complex models.

The modular design facilitates future enhancements, such as adding polynomial regression, regularisation techniques, or expanding testing scenarios.
